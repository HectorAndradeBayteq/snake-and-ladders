## Snakes and Ladders Kata

Snakes and Ladders is a board game involving two or more players rolling dice in order to move their tokens across a board. The board is made up of a collection of numbered squares and is adorned with 'snakes' and 'ladders', which link two squares on the board- snakes link the squares downwards whilst ladders link them going upwards. This means that landing at the bottom of a ladder moves you to the top of that ladder, whereas landing on the top of a snake moves you to the bottom of that snake. The objective of the game is to get your token to the final square before your opponents do. Details about this kata [here](Documents/PROBLEM.md).
